   WEZIDE — My Type Narrative Engine  (mytype-narrative.txt)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Loaded via <script src="mytype-narrative.txt"></script> AFTER mytype.txt.
   Deliberately self-contained: does not read MYTYPE_QUESTIONS or any other
   global from mytype.txt. Only needs the raw `answers` object that
   actionGetMyType() already returns ({ q01: 73, q02: 40, ... }).

   Why separate from mytype.txt (locked decision, see handoff):
   page 1 (existing, ships to everyone) and page 2 (this file) are meant to
   stay independently editable/removable — e.g. a future paywall can gate
   page 2 without touching page 1's code at all.

   Public entry point other files should call:
     buildMyTypeNarrativePage(displayName, answers) -> HTML string for page 2

   Guardrails carried over from wezide-my-type-narrative-engine-spec.md §10:
   - mapping + narrative content live in data objects below, not if/else chains
   - raw input validated to 0..100 (see mteCalculateDimension)
   - a dimension with too few / no answered contributing questions degrades
     gracefully (confidence:'low' or null) instead of crashing or headlining
   - q50 was originally "duplicate of q11, exclude" in the spec's own
     numbering — but real q50 in production ("Touchy-Feely <-> Give Me Space")
     is a genuine, different question, confirmed by Pop to be scored (not
     excluded), mapped into relationship_orientation. See note on q50 below.
   - never phrase output as hiring/performance/mental-health conclusions

   1. Question -> dimension mapping (all 50 real MYTYPE_QUESTIONS keys)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   IMPORTANT: the original spec (wezide-my-type-narrative-engine-spec.md §4)
   numbered its own q01..q50 in a DIFFERENT order than the deployed
   MYTYPE_QUESTIONS array in mytype.txt. Every row below was re-matched by
   comparing actual question text (a/b pair), not by q-number, so these keys
   are safe to use directly against the real `answers` object. `pref:true`
   entries are display-only chips (per spec: never used as scoring evidence).
